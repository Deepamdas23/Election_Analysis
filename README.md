# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, we are assisting a Colorado board of elections employee with election audit results using Python. 
The Python script will be compiling:
- total number of votes cast
- total number of votes cast for each candidate
- percentage of votes for each candidate
- the winner based on popular vote
- the total number of votes by county
- the percentage of votes by county
- the largest county turn out

## Election Results
-------------------
Total Votes: 369711

----------

County Breakdown:
 - Jefferson: 10.5% (38855)
 - Denver: 82.8% (306055)
 - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24801)

Denver County had the largest voter turnout

-------

Candidate Breakdown:
 - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85213)
 - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272892)
 - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11606)

Winner: Diana DeGette  
Winning Vote Count: 272892  
Winning Percentage: 73.8%  

----------

## Summary
- This Python script can be used for any election without any modification, given that provided dataset follows same structure as current one.

- With little modifications, one can add more information to audit such as voter's age, sex and race. This would require additional dictionaries and script block for each category desired.
